#### Hello World Demo

Today we had our Hello World demo. Some groups had gotten really far into their projects whereas others had only done some graphics. I felt that we were in the middle with our project. We demonstrated last of all and it was quite successful. The audience laughed and had good ideas about things:

-Use booster objects so that the car increases speed when driving on the boster
-Use an invisible plane in the SCENE (not connected to any image target) to counter gravity causing the car to fall down into the middle of the Earth immediately.
-Look into the car game HOT WHEELS from the 90s
-Decouple models from targets once they have been recognized by the camera ...
...and more.

Arham jumped ship unfortunetaly, we wish him good luck. The rest of us will look into some stuff during the weekend and then meet next week to formally continue the work and divide it into subtasks.
