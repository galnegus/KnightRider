#### Why

Knight Rider is all about having a fun and interactive experience in AR. Given a game board and some additional tools the user have to use these tools to make a car run from the start to the finish line.
As AR is still a rather undiscovered area, we felt there was a real possibility to create something new and unique.  
 
The graphics is simple yet advanced enough to give the users a great visual experience. With the limitations of mobile devices, graphically advanced effects where occluded to avoid bad framerate and hence a bad user experience. This makes the interaction the core element of the experience, where you have to attach different markers to the game board in order to complete the level.
