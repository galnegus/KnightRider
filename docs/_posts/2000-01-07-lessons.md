#### Lessons learned

- Doing an AR game is not like doing a traditional game. The technique will limit you both in what you can do and how you do it. This especially goes for tracking of markers / fiducials which is not common to all AR libraries.
- Always aim low and improve later rather than aiming for the sky and producing nothing that is finished in its entirey. This cannot be stressed enough.
- Do graphics programming the right way and you can have waterfalls, sunsets and a hundred warriors fighting at the same time but doing it wrong, even the simplest light source becomes a burden for the processor.
